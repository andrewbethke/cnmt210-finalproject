# CNMT 210 Final Project

This is Andrew Bethke's Final Project for CNMT 210, Web Design and Development 1, at the University of Wisconsinâ€”Stevens Point during the Fall 2023 Semester. Apparently you can't share a private GitHub repo by link like I thought you could, so I guess this is going to be a public repository. I guess it's proof that I know *something* about HTML and CSS, at least?
