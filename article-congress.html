                    <p><i>The following article is satirical speculative fiction. Nothing about what it says about years
                            after 2023 should be trusted (and I didn't even fact check all the stuff from before 2023,
                            so just be wary of trusting anything I say).</i></p>

                    <p>WASHINGTON — The United States Congress today is once again debating a tax on carbon emissions
                        by corporations. Defectors in both parties have ensured that both chambers are almost perfectly
                        split, leaving the bill's future uncertain. Proponents say that tax would be an important step
                        towards stopping the continuing slippage of climate change goals and runaway global warming,
                        while opponents reject the idea of levying new taxes during a time of economic hardship caused
                        by the aforementioned runaway global warming.</p>

                    <p>The bill, the Create Less Emissions And Radiation Act (CLEAR Act) of 2045, would require
                        corporations with an annual gross income of over $10 million to track their emissions of carbon
                        dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases, and levy a tax of $150 per metric ton of carbon
                        dioxide equivalent on those emissions. The Act also targets companies that allow ionizing
                        radiation to leak into the environment surrounding their facilities, by both heightening
                        penalties once a leak is discovered and creating a streamlined legal process for cancer patients
                        who lived near a radiation leak to get compensated.</p>

                    <p>This is hardly the first time a carbon tax proposal has been brought before Congress. The
                        solution has been one of the most popular climate change prevention proposals for over 50 years,
                        since an effort by activists in the State of Minnesota popularized the idea. Since then,
                        variations of the idea have been present in more than a thousand different bills brought before
                        congress, with none of those bills actually making it to the President's desk.</p>

                    <p>We'll keep on this developing story as the bill makes it way through Congress. Importantly, the
                        CLEAR Act's future is uncertain even if it passes both chambers, as President Pratt has refused
                        to come out for or against the bill. The only statement we have on the President's stance is
                        from his father-in-law, the former Governor of California, who claims the President supports the
                        "common sense" measure, but critics of the President say that his silence speaks volumes on
                        where his feelings really lie. </p>
