                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>The Underground Dispatch was founded in the run-up to the 2040 election. We felt that there were
                    several topics that weren't getting as much coverage as they should (topics that were
                    "underground"), and felt that the only way to change that was to cover them ourselves.</p>
                <p>Since then, we have stayed true to our original mission, finding stories that have remained
                    underground despite their impact. With any luck, we'll be able to continue to expand this mission
                    until no news remains underground.</p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Our mission is to find those news stories that the public deserves to know about and to report on
                    those stories, no matter how difficult it may be.</p>
