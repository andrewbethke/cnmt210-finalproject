                    <p><i>The following article is satirical speculative fiction. Nothing about what it says about years
                            after 2023 should be trusted. Events referenced from before 2023 should be accurate... I
                            think.</i></p>
                    <p>Skyscrapers are everywhere. As the world has continued the urbanization trend started by the
                        industrial revolution, these massive buildings have gone from one-of-a-kind marvels to
                        relatively commonplace. They are, after all, the most efficient way to put a lot of people into
                        not a lot of space. However, they could be more efficient. Skyscrapers have a lot of surface
                        area, and that surface area could be used to help combat the worsening of the climate crisis.
                    </p>
                    <p>Renewable energy is great. The ongoing costs are (generally) cheaper than nonrenewable sources
                        and they also don't slowly boil the atmosphere with us inside of it. Renewables aren't without
                        their flaws, though. Hydroelectric dams impede the flow of rivers, which can cause harm to
                        wildlife. Solar and wind farms require massive amounts of land, which doesn't exist near very
                        many population centers. This creates inefficiencies when the generated electricity has to be
                        transported long distances through power lines, wasting energy with every additional mile. There
                        is no way to solve this completely; there just isn't enough wind or sunlight for a city to
                        generate its power with turbines and panels inside the city. What there is, though, is a way to
                        more efficiently use the sunlight we have.</p>
                    <p>How do you combine skyscrapers and solar panels? By taking the massive amount of glass on the
                        outside of a skyscraper and replacing it with transparent solar panels. This technology isn't
                        science fiction; it's existed in some form for over 30 years. The only reason that solar windows
                        aren't commonplace is cost. The transparent solar panels cost far more than regular windows, and
                        they take time to generate a return on investment. A company looking to break even as fast as
                        possible or to sell the end result of their construction sees almost no benefit from installing
                        these energy-generating windows; the extra expense isn't worth it to them. We need to fix that.
                    </p>
                    <p>The solution is simple: pay developers to put solar windows in their buildings. This move would
                        benefit everyone in our cities, and the investment would pay itself back over time as less
                        electricity has to be generated and transported long distances to make it to cities, creating
                        waste due to resistance. This is a no brainer way to get our world closer to zero emissions—why
                        aren't we doing it?</p>
